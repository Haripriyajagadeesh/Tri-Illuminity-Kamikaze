# Tri-Illuminity-Kamikaze
This code tracks the pupil of the pupil and analyses it to find out if he/she is distracted or focused in classes.


# KAMIKAZE
During this Covid-19 era as we all know most of the schools,colleges and universities have started online lectures. So in our project we are aiming to enhance the quality of ONLINE-EDUCATION system. We are using Machine Learning for the Facial Detetction, which can guess whether the student is attentive during the online class or not. This will help the teacher to know how attentive the students are, and will also help the student to know whether he/she is able to concentrate in the class or not.


## Story of the name:
Kamikazes were the suicide bombing planes used by Japan during the World War.
So, we named this project as Kamikaze, because we too are students and also guilty of being "distracted" during classes ðŸ˜…. On one hand, it solves a probelm, but also it is something that will stop us from being distracted
